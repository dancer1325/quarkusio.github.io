:categories: core
:summary: An introduction to Dev Services and a list of all extensions that support Dev Services and their configuration options.
:topics: dev-services,dev-mode,testing

== What Are Dev Services?

* := 👀unconfigured services / Quarkus -- can -- AUTOMATICALLY provision 👀
    ** _Example:_ databases, identity servers, etc
* ALLOWED |
    ** development mode
    ** test mode

* if you include an extension & NOT configure it -> Quarkus -- will AUTOMATICALLY --
    ** start the relevant service -- NORMALLY, via -- https://www.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers]
    ** wire up your application -- to use -- this service

* _Example:_ see xref:getting-started-dev-services.adoc[Your Second Quarkus Application]

== Using Dev Services

* if you include an extension / supports Dev Services & NOT configure a connection | external service-> AUTOMATICALLY started
    ** Reason: 🧠Dev Services' goal == be frictionless 🧠
* requirements
    ** NORMALLY, working container environment ( ALSO supports remote environments)
        *** _Example:_ Docker or Podman
* `quarkus.devservices.timeout`
    ** == property -- about -- startup timeout for Dev Services
        *** by default, 60s
* if you want to use Dev Services | development & test modes + configure a production service -> see xref:config-reference.adoc#default-profiles[configuration profiles]
    ** _Example:_
+
[source, properties]
----
# configure your datasource
%prod.quarkus.datasource.db-kind = postgresql
%prod.quarkus.datasource.username = prod-admin
%prod.quarkus.datasource.password = super-secret
%prod.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase
----

== Disabling Dev Services

* ❌NOT affect the production application ❌
    ** Reason: 🧠this functionality -- is part of the -- Quarkus `deployment` modules🧠

* if you want to disable ALL Dev Services -> use `quarkus.devservices.enabled=false` config property
    ** ❌NORMALLY is NOT needed ❌
        *** Reason: 🧠if you configure EXPLICITTlY a service -> AUTOMATICALLY, Dev Service is disabled 🧠

== Platform Dev Services

* == ALL Dev Services / AVAILABLE | Quarkus Platform

=== AMQP

* TODO:
The AMQP Dev Service will be enabled when the `quarkus-messaging-amqp` extension is present in your application, and
the broker address has not been explicitly configured. More information can be found in the
xref:amqp-dev-services.adoc[AMQP Dev Services Guide].

=== Apicurio Registry

The Apicurio Dev Service will be enabled when the `quarkus-apicurio-registry-avro` extension is present in your application, and it's
address has not been explicitly configured. More information can be found in the
xref:apicurio-registry-dev-services.adoc[Apicurio Registry Dev Services Guide].

include::{generated-dir}/config/quarkus-schema-registry-devservice_quarkus.apicurio-registry.devservices.adoc[opts=optional, leveloffset=+1]

=== Databases

The database Dev Services will be enabled when a reactive or JDBC datasource extension is present in the application,
and the database URL has not been configured. More information can be found in the
xref:databases-dev-services.adoc[Databases Dev Services Guide].

Quarkus provides Dev Services for all databases it supports. Most of these are run in a container, except
H2 and Derby which are run in-process. Dev Services are supported for both JDBC and reactive drivers.

Those relational databases that are running in a container are started using Testcontainers and support "reusable instances";
this implies that if you add the property `testcontainers.reuse.enable=true` in your Testcontainers configuration file,
a property file named `.testcontainers.properties` in your user home, then the databases will not be stopped aggressively
after each run, and can be reused.

N.B. if you opt in for this feature, Quarkus will not reset the state of the database between runs unless you explicitly configure it to.

=== Microcks

The Microcks Quarkus extension includes a Microcks Dev Service. The Dev Service manages mocks for dependencies and contract-testing your API endpoints.
See the extension https://github.com/microcks/microcks-quarkus[README.md] for more information.
